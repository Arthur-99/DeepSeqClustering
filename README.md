# EventSeqDecomp

An **unsupervised event sequence decomposition** method is proposed to mine highly correlated subsequences (clusters) via neural temporal point process and sequential variational autoencoder. Here c-NTPP is further improved with TGAT time encoding function, NRI-like decoder and beta-VAE loss for better event cluster inference.
